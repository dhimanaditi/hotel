        <p>Our story wrote its early chapters in 1934 in Shimla where Mr. M.S. Oberoi pioneered the idea of luxury hospitality in India by opening his first hotel. The lessons self-taught, the inevitable mistakes made, the wisdom gained, the prestigious awards won. All have formed the compass for successive generations of Oberois. </p>
        <p>To this day, we still practice the most simple and uncommon of operational philosophies that began with Mr. M.S. Oberoi himself and now echoed by his son and current chairman Mr. P.R. S. Oberoi: The guest is everything.
            Our joy comes from ensuring each is seen and valued as a person, a friend, a family member who has come to stay. It ‘s present in every gesture through words spoken or unspoken, in ways that are obvious and in ways that are quietly respectful of one’s time and privacy.
        </p>
        <p>You will be hard pressed to find properties as beautiful as ours or restaurants, guest rooms and facilities that are as exceptional. But these are not what give Oberoi Hotels & Resorts its incomparable reputation.
        What our guests speak about most is that singular experience of being truly seen, heard and understood. Something no other hotel or resort can emulate. The astonishing effect one feels from an act, a gesture, a word; that is heart felt.
